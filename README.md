## Features
- Predicts car prices based on various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.
- Trained on a diverse dataset to improve accuracy and reliability.
- Supports multiple regression techniques for improved predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository]. It contains the following relevant features:
- **Make**: Car manufacturer
- **Model**: Specific model of the car
- **Year**: Year of manufacture
- **Mileage**: Distance driven in miles
- **Condition**: Overall condition of the car (e.g., new, used)
- **Location**: Area where the car is listed

### Dataset Description
- Size: 350  rows and 9 columns.
- Missing Values: No missing values in this dataset
- Target Variable: Selling_price.

## Installation
To make use of this model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use the model for predictions, follow these steps:

1. Load the model:
   ```python
   import joblib
   model = joblib.load('model.pkl')
   ```

2. Prepare your input data as a DataFrame:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   input_data = pd.DataFrame({
       'make': ['Toyota'], 
       'model': ['Camry'], 
       'year': [2020], 
       'mileage': [15000], 
       'condition': ['used']
   })
   ```

3. Make predictions:
   ```python
   predicted_price = model.predict(input_data)
   print(f'Predicted Price: ${predicted_price[0]:,.2f}')
   ```

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared values

### Results
- Provide a summary of model accuracy and results here, including graphs or tables if applicable.
